        <h2>Where to find us</h2>
        <p>This year, we'll be at the Informatics Forum, located in the heart of Edinburgh.</p>
        
        <h3>By Public Transport</h3>
        <p>If you're travelling by train, <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/9u4mpBPU26o8vkeF6">Waverely Station</a> is only 10-15 minutes walk away - just head down South Bridge until you get to South College street, then walk down Potterrow.</p>
        <p>If you're travelling from outside Edinburgh by bus, you'll likely arrive at St. Andrew's Station, and can follow the same route.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/transport/travelling-here/central-area/">The university website has more details on how to get to campus.</a></p>

        <h3>By Car</h3>
        <p>The nearest car park is <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/APauafXWt8rbCjgA6">Q-Park Quartermile</a>, about 2 minutes walk away. You can also park on <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/Cg2hAtWwVghZp1bZ6">Holyrood Road</a>, or on <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/mPVuZJiF41uQNBKs9">Castle Terrace</a></p>
